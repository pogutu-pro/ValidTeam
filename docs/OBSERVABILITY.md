# Observability

**Verified:** 2026-08-12

ValidTeam contains optional observability hooks, not a preconfigured
end-to-end stack. OpenTelemetry and Langfuse have guarded runtime adapters;
Sentry application-error export is only an integration seam until SDK
initialization is added. This document distinguishes those states explicitly.

## Layers at a glance

| Layer             | Tool                                       | Activation env                                                | Default  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Error tracking    | Sentry (cloud or self-host)                | SDK initialization plus server/browser DSNs                   | scaffold |
| LLM tracing       | Langfuse (cloud or self-host)              | `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_HOST` | off      |
| Distributed trace | OpenTelemetry → SigNoz / Grafana Tempo     | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`            | off      |
| DB query stats    | `pg_stat_statements` + pgHero / pganalyze  | shipped on by default in `docker-compose.yml`                 | **on**   |
| Realtime (RTC)    | LiveKit Prometheus exporter                | `LIVEKIT_PROMETHEUS_PORT` (set to a free port, e.g. `6789`)   | off      |
| Web process       | Prometheus text endpoint at `/api/metrics` | `METRICS_TOKEN` (minimum 16 characters)                       | off      |

The maintained production Compose file does not forward Sentry, Langfuse, or
OpenTelemetry variables into `web`; add them through a deployment-specific
Compose override or inject them directly into the process. Never commit their
secret values. When their activation variables are absent, the implemented
OpenTelemetry and Langfuse adapters are no-ops in dev and CI.

## OpenTelemetry

The Next.js app loads `instrumentation.ts` on Node-runtime boot and registers
the `@vercel/otel` SDK. Spans are exported via the OTLP HTTP exporter built
into the SDK.

```env
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://signoz-otel-collector:4318
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=validteam-web
# Optional standard OTel knobs:
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=x-honeycomb-team=...
OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=deployment.environment=prod
```

The same file exports the Next.js 15 `onRequestError` hook and delegates to
`@sentry/nextjs` when a DSN exists. The repository does not yet initialize a
Sentry client, so this hook is an extension seam rather than a verified error
export path.

### LLM trace correlation

`apps/web/src/lib/ai/observability/langfuse.ts#traceLlmCall` reads the active
OTel span context and attaches `otelTraceId` / `otelSpanId` to the Langfuse
trace metadata. With both tools open you can copy the trace id out of
SigNoz / Tempo and search Langfuse for the matching LLM call.

## Langfuse

Configure with:

```env
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com   # or your self-host URL
```

Every call to `draftIssue()` / `draftIssuesMulti()` ends with `traceLlmCall()`
which records the prompt, response, latency, and provider. Native (heuristic)
runs are _not_ traced — they're not LLM calls.

To trace a new AI feature, import the helper and call it once per generation:

```ts
import { traceLlmCall } from '@/lib/ai/observability/langfuse';

const started = Date.now();
const result = await myLlmCall();
await traceLlmCall({
  feature: 'sprint.summary',
  provider: 'openai',
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
  input: { prompt },
  output: result,
  latencyMs: Date.now() - started,
});
```

## Sentry

Sentry has two distinct integration surfaces:

1. **OAuth + webhook** — for ingesting Sentry issues into ValidTeam
   (commit `1ea6f14`). Configured under Admin → Integrations.
2. **Application error capture scaffold** — `instrumentation.ts#onRequestError`
   delegates to the installed SDK when a DSN exists, but server/edge/client
   `Sentry.init(...)` configuration is not present. Do not claim export is live
   until initialization and a controlled error smoke test are added.

For client-side errors create `apps/web/sentry.client.config.ts` per the
Sentry Next.js docs.

## Postgres — `pg_stat_statements`

Loaded at server start via `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
command:
  - postgres
  - -c
  - shared_preload_libraries=pg_stat_statements
  - -c
  - pg_stat_statements.track=all
  - -c
  - pg_stat_statements.max=10000
```

`docker/postgres/init.sql` then runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS
pg_stat_statements` on first boot. Verify with:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_statements;
SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time
  FROM pg_stat_statements
 ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
 LIMIT 20;
```

### Visualizers

- **pgHero** (open source, self-host) — drop-in Docker container that reads
  `pg_stat_statements`:

  ```bash
  # Set this in your shell/secret manager; do not commit it.
  export PGHERO_DATABASE_URL='postgres://USER:PASSWORD@host.docker.internal:5432/validteam'
  docker run -d --name pghero \
    -e DATABASE_URL="$PGHERO_DATABASE_URL" \
    -p 8080:8080 ankane/pghero
  ```

  Add as a service in your prod compose file behind your internal-only network.

- **pganalyze** (SaaS, commercial) — install the collector container and
  point it at the same DATABASE_URL. Better long-term retention + EXPLAIN
  capture, paid.

## LiveKit Prometheus

LiveKit exposes a `/metrics` endpoint when `prometheus_port` is set. Toggle
via env:

```env
LIVEKIT_PROMETHEUS_PORT=6789
```

`docker/livekit/start-livekit.sh` emits the `prometheus_port:` block when the
var is set to a non-zero value. Because the LiveKit container uses
`network_mode: host`, the metrics endpoint is reachable on the host at
`http://<host>:6789/metrics`.

Add a scrape target to your Prometheus / SigNoz collector config:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'livekit'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['host.docker.internal:6789']
```

Key series to alert on: `livekit_room_participants`, `livekit_packets_lost`,
`livekit_node_cpu_load`.

### Recommended self-host stack (single VM)

For a single-VM hobby / small-team deployment we suggest:

1. **Sentry** — managed or self-hosted error tracking after SDK initialization.
2. **Langfuse** — managed or self-hosted LLM tracing.
3. **SigNoz** single-node Docker — OpenTelemetry + APM + logs in one UI.
4. **pgHero** in the existing Docker Compose network —
   `pg_stat_statements` is already on by default.
5. **LiveKit Prometheus** exporter scraped by SigNoz collector.

## Verifying after enabling

After injecting the variables through the process environment or a Compose
override, restart the web container and run:

```bash
# OTel
curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/api/health
# expect a span in your collector within ~30s

# Langfuse
# make an AI call (Settings → AI & Agents → "Try draft issue")
# expect a generation in the Langfuse UI within ~30s

# pg_stat_statements
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_statements;"

# LiveKit
curl -fsS http://localhost:${LIVEKIT_PROMETHEUS_PORT:-6789}/metrics | head
```

If a check fails, inspect that layer's logs and health independently.
OpenTelemetry registration and Langfuse emission are designed to warn and
continue; do not generalize that behavior to PostgreSQL, LiveKit, or an
uninitialized Sentry client.
