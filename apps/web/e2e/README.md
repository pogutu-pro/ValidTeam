# ValidTeam web — Playwright E2E suite

End-to-end tests for the Next.js app in `apps/web`, driven by
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev). The suite covers signup, first-run
workspace setup, authenticated app surfaces, mobile layout, the issue lifecycle,
the Kanban board, the Cmd+K command palette, the AI draft dialog, and the public
design contract across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

## Layout

```
apps/web/
  playwright.config.ts        # web server + 3 browser projects + storage state
  e2e/
    .auth/                    # storage state (gitignored)
    fixtures/seed.ts          # deterministic seeder (idempotent)
    auth.setup.ts             # signs in once, persists storage state
    public-surfaces.spec.ts   # public route × viewport × light/dark contract
    app-surfaces.spec.ts      # authenticated route smoke and interaction checks
    mobile-layout.spec.ts     # 320/390px authenticated layout contract
    signup.spec.ts            # public — email/password registration
    workspace-setup.spec.ts   # public — first-run admin wizard
    issue-lifecycle.spec.ts   # authed — create → priority → assign → close
    kanban-board.spec.ts      # authed — keyboard DnD + API persistence
    cmd-k-palette.spec.ts     # authed — Cmd+K, search "create issue"
    ai-draft.spec.ts          # authed — Draft with AI (route stubbed)
```

## One-time setup

```bash
# From the repo root:
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @validteam/web exec playwright install --with-deps
```

`--with-deps` installs Linux shared libraries needed by Chromium/Firefox/WebKit
and may prompt for sudo. Drop the flag if you already have the host deps.

Complete the [root development setup](../../../README.md#development) first so
the ignored environment files and required Compose secrets exist. The E2E suite
also needs PostgreSQL and Redis:

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait postgres redis
pnpm --filter @validteam/db db:migrate
```

## Running the suite

```bash
# Full headless run (all browsers)
pnpm --filter @validteam/web tests:e2e

# Interactive UI mode — best for authoring & debugging
pnpm --filter @validteam/web tests:e2e:ui

# Single spec, single browser
pnpm --filter @validteam/web exec playwright test e2e/cmd-k-palette.spec.ts --project=chromium

# Public 320/390/desktop × light/dark surface contract
pnpm --filter @validteam/web tests:e2e:public

# Opt in to successful mobile audit screenshots (failure artifacts are automatic)
UI_AUDIT=1 pnpm --filter @validteam/web exec playwright test e2e/mobile-layout.spec.ts --project=chromium
```

Playwright auto-starts `pnpm dev` on `http://localhost:3000` (and reuses the
server if it is already running locally). Override with `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`
to point at a deployed environment.

## How auth + seeding works

`auth.setup.ts` runs _before_ every authed project and:

1. Calls `ensureSeed()` to insert (idempotently) the `E2E Workspace`
   organization, an admin user (`e2e-admin@validteam.test` /
   `E2eAdmin!2026`), a project `E2E`, a workflow with three statuses, and
   five seed issues (`E2E-1`..`E2E-5`).
2. POSTs credentials to `/api/auth/callback/credentials` with a fresh CSRF
   token, then visits `/dashboard` to materialize the session cookies.
3. Writes the resulting `storageState` to `e2e/.auth/admin.json`, which is
   then shared by every authed project via the `storageState` use option.

The public specs (`public-surfaces`, `signup`, `workspace-setup`) run without
storage state under the `chromium-public` project.

## Artifacts

- `apps/web/test-results/` — per-test traces, screenshots, and video.
- `apps/web/playwright-report/` — HTML report.
- Traces and screenshots are captured _only on failure_ to keep the working
  directory small. Open the HTML report with
  `pnpm --filter @validteam/web exec playwright show-report`.

## CI

When CI coverage is restored, run this suite on pull requests with Postgres
and Redis service containers, apply migrations, run the seeder, execute the
suite, and upload trace artifacts on failure.

## Known follow-ups

- **AI provider coverage.** `ai-draft.spec.ts` deliberately mocks
  `/api/ai/draft-issues` via `page.route(...)`; add a separate
  controlled-environment route/provider test rather than a production runtime
  flag.
- **Sharding.** When E2E is added to CI, start with one shard. For larger suites
  switch to `--shard=N/M` and emit JUnit so GitHub annotations group correctly.
- **Visual regression.** Not in scope here; covered in the design-system QA
  task.
